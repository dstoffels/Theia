  description: 'The Sapian is a common sight on Theia. They are an upright bipedal
    species with keen vision, smooth skin with a range of earthy pigmentations, and
    wildly varying hairstyles. Sapians are most widely known for their adaptability
    to nearly any environment or occupation. Many modern-day Sapians share lineage
    with other elder bloodlines, but the Sapian traits are overwhelmingly dominant.
    Short gestation periods and a relatively quick maturation rate combined with
    their innate compatibility with the other denizens of the lands had caused Sapian
    society to rapidly expand prior to the Great Schism, and their survivability
    is undeniable.

    

    Sapians have largely earned the reputation of having
    impatient and short-sighted temperaments, but possess an unusual amount of determination
    - even to the point of stubbornness. Even with this stigma (and perhaps because
    of the growing ire of many other species), Sapian attitudes can be as varied
    as their appearances.

    

    Today, much of their society is still in disarray
    due to the territory wars that followed the Great Schism. This infighting carries
    on even today, as several of the disasters that occurred during this time of
    turmoil disproportionately affected Sapian lands. Many Sapians now find their
    livelihoods as farmers and craftsmen, eking out an existence from the cursed
    lands and huddling together in scared little hamlets. A near-equal amount regress
    from society completely, preferring to ply trade as raiders, mercenaries, or
    traveling priests. Still fewer risk their lives as scavengers, braving dangerous
    ruins for the relics of the past.'
